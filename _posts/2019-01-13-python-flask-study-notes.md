Today I started to learn python flask

网上有不少python flask的教程啦 我就是记录记录我学了啥

I followed along with this youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH

lesson: basic setup
In order to make the localhost reflexing what's new in the code,
instead of ctl+c and then flask run. There are two ways to automate
it:
1. set up a environemnt varibale:
just type in the terminal export FLASK_DEBUG=1 (notice! no space around the equal sign, otherwise bash is gonna complain with "bad assignment")
